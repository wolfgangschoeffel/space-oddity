        <section class="description">
            <p>The group exhibition SPACE ODDITY, produced by Büro Unfun, a collective of graphic artists from Nuremberg and the artist Ernst Sylvester, brings together different positions of contemporary art from Israel and Germany. Based on mutual visits in Nuremberg, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the partly personal connection of the participating artists is coined by intense conversations regarding their individual artistic positions. The jointly developed project aims to transform the interaction which has derived from a personal, friendship-like relationship into an actual space at the Kunstverein Nuremberg and functions as a real encounter of artworks and notions.

            <p>The title SPACE ODDITY refers to the first music video shot in outer space – a cover version of David Bowie‘s song ”Space Oddity“, performed by ISS-Commander Chris Hadfield. The title simultaneously refers to the curiosity and unusualness one might feel when experiencing still unexplored places. Inspired by the International Space Station (ISS) – a project that enables scientists coming from all over the world and having grown up within different political systems to live together peacefully in a satellite – the project provides the possibility to meet in an experimental as well as a concentrated environment. The basic idea of a time- and space capsule with different social and physical laws creates a contact zone, in which one can impartially and inquisitively think about the future.</p>

            <p>Like the structure of a space station, the exhibition understands itself as a modular system, where intense interaction can be created as soon as its forms an functions overlap. The interdisciplinary working Büro Unfun will create a spatial design which is based on the idea of a modularity that sets the single works in relation to each other. This concept fosters the emergence of a greater flexible unit.</p>

            <p>Taking significant aspects into consideration it is also very essential to know about the history of Germany and the city of Nuremberg during the time of National Socialism. Creating a experimental space that refers to the idea of outer space is not an attempt to create a space of unawareness and indifference to political and historical issues. SPACE ODDITY aims to create a meeting place that shifts perspectives and focuses on artistic positions. The exhibition tries to initiate and maintain examinations with reasonable ease on familiar topics – such as current political developments in regions like the Middle East – and condense into a multi-layered dialogue.</p>

            <p>In the Kunstverein Nuremberg, the artworks by Amir Yatziv, David Havrony and Yana Rotner, students and graduates of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design Jerusalem, will converge with the positions by Ernst Sylvester (lives and works in Nuremberg) and Peter Hermans (lives and works in Leipzig). The Büro Unfun from Nuremberg, having realized several artistic projects, will develop an spatial design and the visual communication for the exhibition. Unfun operates on the cut surface of art and design and dissolves</p>
